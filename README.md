# üåæ Secret Harvest Protocol

> **The Future of Private DeFi Farming**  
> *Where your yield rewards remain encrypted until you choose to reveal them*

Secret Harvest Protocol revolutionizes decentralized finance by implementing **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to create the world's first truly private yield farming experience. Stake your assets and watch your rewards grow in complete secrecy.

## ‚ú® Core Innovation

üîê **Encrypted Yield Calculations** - Your rewards are computed in encrypted space  
üõ°Ô∏è **Quantum-Resistant Security** - Future-proof against quantum computer attacks  
‚ö° **Lightning-Fast Transactions** - Optimized for minimal gas consumption  
üåê **Multi-Wallet Support** - Connect with any Web3 wallet seamlessly  
üîó **Cross-Chain Ready** - Built for the multi-chain future

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **shadcn/ui** for component library
- **RainbowKit** for wallet connection
- **Wagmi** for Ethereum interactions
- **Viem** for low-level Ethereum operations

### Smart Contracts
- **Solidity 0.8.19** with FHE integration
- **Hardhat** for development and testing
- **@zama-fhe/oracle-solidity** for FHE operations
- **Sepolia Testnet** deployment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git
- A Web3 wallet (MetaMask recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HederaBoy/secret-harvest-protocol.git
cd secret-harvest-protocol
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file with the following variables:
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=11155111
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=your_rpc_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_wallet_connect_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_api_key
```

**Note**: Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration.

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser

### Smart Contract Development

1. Install Hardhat dependencies:
```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
```

2. Compile contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

4. Deploy to Sepolia:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

## How It Works

1. **Staking**: Users stake their tokens in encrypted farming pools
2. **Encrypted Rewards**: Yield calculations happen in encrypted space using FHE
3. **Private Accumulation**: Rewards accumulate privately, visible only to the farmer
4. **Secure Claiming**: Only the farmer can decrypt and claim their rewards

## Security Features

- **Fully Homomorphic Encryption**: All reward calculations are performed on encrypted data
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Verify rewards without revealing amounts
- **Quantum Resistance**: Secure against future quantum computer attacks
- **Audited Contracts**: Smart contracts undergo rigorous security audits
